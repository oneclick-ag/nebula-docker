[Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) is a scalable overlay networking
tool with a focus on performance, simplicity and security. It lets you
seamlessly connect computers anywhere in the world. Nebula is portable, and
runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows. (Also: keep this quiet, but we have an early
prototype running on iOS). It can be used to connect a small number of
computers, but is also able to connect tens of thousands of computers.

## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as x86-64, arm64 and armhf. We
utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is
available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list).

Simply pulling [ocdev/nebula](https://github.com/oneclick-ag/nebula-docker)
should retrieve the correct image for your arch.

## Version Tags

This image provides various versions that are available via tags. `latest` tag
usually provides the latest stable version. Others are considered under
development and caution must be exercised when using them.

| Tag    | Description            |
| :----: | ---                    |
| latest | Stable Nebula Releases |
| edge   | Latest Nebula Releases |
| v1.6.0 | Nebula 1.6.0 Release   |

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker

```bash
docker pull ocdev/nebula:latest
```

and
```bash
docker run -td --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --device=/dev/net/tun -v /path/to/config:/config --name nebula ocdev/nebula:latest
```

or as a privileged container:
```bash
docker run -td --privileged -v /path/to/config:/config --name nebula ocdev/nebula:latest
```

User documentation for Nebula can be found at
https://github.com/slackhq/nebula#readme

### Kubernetes Sidecar

For testing, you can use a ConfigMap, but for production it is better to use
secrets.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: 'nebula-conf'
data:
  nebula.conf: |
    # You can insert your config.yaml here.
    # You can/need also insert certificates here,
    # as in the example below.
    pki:
      ca: |
        -----BEGIN NEBULA CERTIFICATE-----
        certificate data
        -----END NEBULA CERTIFICATE-----
      cert: |
        -----BEGIN NEBULA CERTIFICATE-----
        certificate data
        -----END NEBULA CERTIFICATE-----
      key: |
        -----BEGIN NEBULA X25519 PRIVATE KEY-----
        certificate data
        -----END NEBULA X25519 PRIVATE KEY-----
    # the rest of the config file.
```

and
```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ...
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ...

    spec:
      containers:
        - name: ...
        - name: nebula
          image: ocdev/nebula:v1.2.0
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              add:
                - NET_ADMIN
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /config/config.yaml
              readOnly: true
              name: nebula-conf
            - mountPath: /dev/net/tun
              name: devnet
          args: ["-config", "/config/config.yaml" ] 
      volumes:
        - name: nebula-conf
          configMap:
            name: nebula-conf
            items:
              - key: nebula.conf
                path: config.yaml
        - name: devnet
          hostPath:
            path: /dev/net/tun
```

or as a privileged container:
```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ...
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ...
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: ...
        - name: nebula
          image: ocdev/nebula:v1.2.0
          securityContext:
            privileged: true
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /config/config.yaml
              readOnly: true
              name: nebula-conf
          args: ["-config", "/config/config.yaml" ] 
      volumes:
        - name: nebula-conf
          configMap:
            name: nebula-conf
            items:
              - key: nebula.conf
                path: config.yaml
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as
those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate
`<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose
port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port
`8080` outside the container.

| Parameter    | Function                        |
| :----:       | ---                             |
| `-v /config` | Nebula configuration directory. |

## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it nebula /bin/sh`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f nebula`
* container version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' nebula`
* image version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' ocdev/nebula`

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and
container recreation to update the app inside. We do not recommend or support
updating apps inside the container.

An automated process for upgrading your container is available
via [containrrr/watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower).
